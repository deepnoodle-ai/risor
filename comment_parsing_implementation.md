# Comment Parsing Implementation Status for Risor

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation status of comment parsing in the Risor scripting language. The implementation successfully parses comments as first-class AST nodes throughout the compilation pipeline.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Token Layer (`token/token.go`)**
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Added `COMMENT` token type to the token enumeration
- The token system now recognizes comments as a valid token type

### 2. **Lexer Layer (`lexer/lexer.go`)**
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Modified lexer to emit `COMMENT` tokens instead of skipping comments
- **Supported Comment Types**:
  - Single-line comments with `//`
  - Single-line comments with `#` (shell-style)
  - Multi-line comments with `/* */`
- **Key Implementation**: 
  - `readComment()` function for single-line comments
  - `readMultiLineComment()` function for multi-line comments
  - Both functions properly handle newlines and EOF conditions

### 3. **AST Layer (`ast/statements.go`)**
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Implemented `Comment` struct with full `Node` interface
- **Features**:
  - Implements `StatementNode()` interface
  - Provides `Text()` method to access comment content
  - Proper `String()` representation
  - Maintains token information for position tracking

### 4. **Parser Layer (`parser/parser.go`)**
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Added comment parsing support
- **Implementation**:
  - `parseComment()` function creates `Comment` AST nodes
  - Registered as prefix parser for `token.COMMENT`
  - Integrated into statement parsing flow
  - Comments are treated as statements in the AST

### 5. **Compiler Layer (`compiler/compiler.go`)**
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Added support for `*ast.Comment` nodes
- **Implementation**: Comments are recognized but generate no bytecode (correct behavior)
- **Fix Applied**: Added case for `*ast.Comment` that returns early without generating instructions

## Test Coverage

### ✅ **Lexer Tests**
- All existing lexer tests updated to expect `COMMENT` tokens
- Tests for single-line comments (`//` and `#`)
- Tests for multi-line comments (`/* */`)
- Tests for shebang comments

### ✅ **Parser Tests**
- All existing parser tests pass
- Comprehensive comment parsing tests in `comment_test.go`
- Tests for various comment scenarios and positions

### ✅ **Compiler Tests**
- All compiler tests pass
- Comments compile without errors
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality

## Supported Comment Syntax

```risor
// Single-line comment (C-style)
x := 42

# Single-line comment (shell-style)
y := "hello"

/* Multi-line comment
   spanning multiple lines
   with proper handling */
z := true

// Inline comments work too
result := x + y // this is an inline comment
```

## Current Status: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The comment parsing implementation is **complete and functional** with the following capabilities:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Comments are properly tokenized
2. **Parsing**: Comments are parsed into AST nodes
3. **Compilation**: Comments are handled without generating bytecode
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage at all layers

## Architecture Benefits

1. **First-Class AST Nodes**: Comments are treated as proper AST nodes, enabling:
   - Source code formatting tools
   - Documentation generation
   - Code analysis tools
   - IDE integrations

2. **Position Tracking**: Comments maintain their source position information
3. **Multiple Styles**: Support for both C-style (`//`, `/* */`) and shell-style (`#`) comments
4. **No Runtime Overhead**: Comments generate no bytecode

## Integration Notes

- The implementation is backward compatible
- Existing code continues to work without changes
- Comments can be extracted from AST for documentation tools
- The compiler properly handles mixed comment styles

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- **Documentation Comments**: Special handling for doc comments (e.g., `/** */`)
- **Comment Directives**: Support for special comment-based directives
- **IDE Integration**: Enhanced support for comment-based features

## Conclusion

The comment parsing implementation for Risor is **complete and production-ready**. All layers of the language pipeline properly handle comments, from lexical analysis through compilation. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while providing a solid foundation for future comment-based features.
