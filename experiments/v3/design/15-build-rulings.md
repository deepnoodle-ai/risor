# Risor v3: rulings made during the build

Status: a record. The owner gave the design lead the design and
implementation decisions on 2026-11-09 ("you call the shots"), so each ruling
below is in force. Any of them can be reversed: say which.

When the specification under `spec/` and a design document `00` to `13`
disagree, **the specification wins**. The design documents are the reasons;
the specification is the rule. This file lists each place where the
specification settles or changes what a design document says, so the two can
be compared without reading both.

A ruling that only confirms a design document is not listed. The full list of
questions and answers for a round is kept with the build's working files.

## 1. Decisions taken to start the build

Section 7 of `14` was taken as recommended.

| # | Ruling |
| --- | --- |
| D37 | An `if` must have an `else`. |
| D38 | `match` by conditions is not in 3.0. `match {` with no subject is a parse error. |
| Codes | Code names are as the design documents write them. |
| Line | Core and follow-on are as `14` sections 2, 3 and 5 say. |
| D8, D10 to D13, D15 to D17, D21, D25, D31 | As recommended in `00`. |
| D23 | Open. Go tests use wonton's `assert` until it is settled. |
| Layout | `spec/`, `suite/`, `go/`, `ts/`, `rust/`. v2's code stays on the branch for now. |
| Parser | Each lexer and parser is written by hand, a Pratt parser. Settled by the owner. |

## 2. Round 1: the five Core chapters

### 2.1 Changes to a design document

| # | Ruling | Changes | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | `_ => e` is a lambda, the same as `(_) => e`. | `02` 2.2, the `Lambda` rule (edited) | `(_) => e` already parsed. An author from TypeScript writes `_ =>`. |
| R2 | `x in list` charges, for each element compared, 1 step, plus the size of the common prefix when both are strings, plus the steps of `==` when both are lists of one length or maps of one size. | `04` A.3, "1 per element compared" | Comparing long text or deep lists was work with no charge, against C5. A list of numbers costs what it cost. |
| R3 | `s[i]` on a string charges 1 + the size of `s`. | `04` A.3, "index: 1" | Finding position `i` reads the text; `02` 2.14 already lists it as work that grows. A string under 64 in weight costs what it cost. |
| R4 | A failed element test of a library entry (`sum`, `flat`, `join`, `toMap`, the ordered test) charges 1 step for each element tested. | `06`, silent | `wrong-kind` can be caught, so a free scan inside a callback was unbounded work. |
| R5 | `sum` has the signature `() => T \| int where T: number`. | `06` 2.8 | `[].sum()` had type `never` and the value `0`. Now its type is `int`. |
| R6 | `int("1e400")` fails with `invalid-argument`, form `not-finite`, as `float("1e400")` does. | `06`, which lists the form for `float` only | One text, one answer from both. |
| R7 | `string(x)` charges the walk that a template charges. | `06` open question 5, and `06` 2.8 "1 per element and entry walked" | One rendering, one cost, wherever it happens. |
| R8 | `03` example: `gate.failed \|\| "none"` has type `int \| "none"`. | `03` 2.9 (edited) | An error in the example. |

### 2.2 Rules the design documents did not have

| # | Ruling |
| --- | --- |
| R9 | **Every implementation runs the static rules**, with or without a type checker: unknown names, calls of what is not a function, lambdas where none may stand, duplicate names, keys and cases, the count of arguments of a call by name. They need no types. Otherwise the three evaluators would accept different programs until each had its checker. |
| R10 | Every implementation parses type text, since it needs the names of variables and the count of parameters of functions. |
| R11 | The suite has `core-run/`, which needs no type checker, and `core-check/`, which does. |
| R12 | A case may carry `precondition: false` from Core on. Core runners ignore it; F9 gives it its meaning. So no Core case is edited later. |
| R13 | The usage of a run that fails on a limit is not fixed, and a case must not state it. The usage of every other failed run is exact. |
| R14 | Null as a receiver, operand, index, key or spread operand is `null-operand`. Null as an argument or an element of a library entry is `wrong-kind`. |
| R15 | On `any` data, a method the receiver's kind lacks, and a count of arguments that method does not take, are `wrong-kind` at run time, raised before the arguments are evaluated. |
| R16 | `a ** b` with `b` below zero: an infinite `a ** -b` gives zero, a zero one gives `number-range`, and `a` zero gives `divide-by-zero`. |
| R17 | The first `parse` diagnostic: the whole text is tokenized, and a lexical diagnostic comes before any syntax diagnostic. It is the one rule that three hand-written parsers cannot read differently. |
| R18 | `null-operand` and `wrong-kind` are raised before the operation charges. Every other code is raised after. |
| R19 | Opaque types and their declared methods are in Core. |
| R20 | The largest depth a host may set is 1,000. Steps and allocation limits are whole numbers of 0 or more. |
| R21 | The run-phase catalog has 61 templates, not the "about 33" of `14` 2.3: one for each shape, so a message names what was found. |
| R22 | The case table for `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase` is a file of the suite, `casemap.json`, made from Unicode 16.0.0. No implementation uses its platform's tables. |
| R23 | The message of a `parse` or `check` diagnostic is not specified in Core. Its code and span are. F8 brings the catalog for those phases. |

## 3. Round 2: work that was not charged

The limits promise that the work of a run is at most a constant times the
steps charged (`04` L2). An audit of the Core chapters found work that grew
with no charge. Each fix adds a term that is zero for a string under 64 code
points, so no ordinary program costs more.

| # | Ruling | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R24 | **The key rule.** Probing or building a map by a key charges the size of the key: `m[k]`, `m.name`, `x in m`, each entry of a map literal, a map spread, a map pattern, `==` on maps, `groupBy`, `toMap`. | `04` A.3, several rows; `06` 2.8 |
| R25 | **Searching text is linear.** A search for `x` in `s` does work of at most a constant times the two lengths. An implementation uses its platform's search only where that holds, and one of its own otherwise. Binds `in` on strings, `split` and `replaceAll`. | `04`, `06`: silent |
| R26 | `unique`, `toMap` and `groupBy` are done with a hash set or map, so their expected work is linear. | `06`: silent |
| R27 | R4 is narrowed: only a scan made before the entry's charges pays on failure. A callback's result or key that fails its test was already paid for with its element. | R4 |
| R28 | `a != b` charges what `a == b` charges, not the extra step of a `!`. | `02` 2.7, which defines it as `!(a == b)` |

## 4. Round 3: a lambda at a method call

A lambda at a method call needs the receiver's type, so its rules are type
rules and not static rules. With a receiver of type `any`, or in an
implementation with no type checker, nothing said what the run does.

| # | Ruling | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R29 | **The shape test.** At a method call that was not resolved when compiling, the run tests, before any argument is evaluated: the method exists for the receiver's kind; it takes that count of arguments; each callback parameter gets a lambda; no other parameter gets one; no lambda has more parameters than it is called with. The first failure is `wrong-kind` at the call. | R15, which had the first two |
| R30 | `wrong-kind` gains the templates `callback`, `not-callback` and `parameters`. The catalog has 64. | R21 |
| R31 | A method name written without a call is a field read, never `not-a-value`. `m.keys` reads the key `keys`. | `06` 2.3 |
